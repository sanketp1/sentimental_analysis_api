Who wouldn't die in the face of superior weapons, or did y'all think they were immortal. 

Also, human beings are greedy, it's in our nature. The same greed that brought the slave traders to the African shores to buy slaves, is the same greed that moved the Africans to sell their own people for the weapons and goods they were given in return. And yet we've seen you guys praise movies that have inaccurately depicted the role of the "whites" as saviors who ended slave trade, when they were only quenching the fire they started once they no longer had use for it. So instead of doing a quick google search and coming here to pretend like you know our history, why don't y'all actually do a proper research.  

The fragile masculinity aside, I do agree that a lot of liberties were taken in the making of this movie. For one, they were a bit heavy handed in depicting the Dahomey people as completely good natured. They also participated in the slave trade, just like the other kingdoms and empires.
  
The "West African" accents used in the movie were also not quit accurate, but it was a good effort.
